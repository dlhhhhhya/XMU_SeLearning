今天我准备的内容是从之前的一份听力材料得来的，当我看到这份英语材料的标题的时候，我对它的故事非常的好奇：它究竟讲的是什么呢？现在让我来介绍一下这篇材料吧。在这个故事中，我们仅仅知道三个身份，一个是工人，一个是警察，还有一个是学生，虽然凭借他们的外表很容易就能分辨出他们的工作，但是他们中的两者者竟然会不认识互相，这是为什么呢？这起源于一场骗局。原来一个大学生想戏弄人，他看见有工人在学校门外干活，他就报告警察说，有学生装扮成工人在破坏学校，接着他去告诉工人，要是有个警察过来，就不要把他当回事。工人和警察都对此深信不疑，直到故事结尾，他们才知道被这个学生给骗了。这个故事告诉了我们，我们需要拥有一个成熟的思想，要照顾他人的感受，不要去开玩笑来造成他人的困扰。这就是我对这个听力材料的收获，谢谢大家。

Today I prepared the content from a previous listening material. When I saw the title of this English material, I was very curious about its story: what exactly is it about? Now let me introduce this material. In this story, we know just three identities, one is a workman, one is a police, and one is a student. Although it is easy to distinguish their jobs by virtue of their appearance, it is surprising that the two of them would not know each other, why? This is a hoax.It turned out that a college student wanted to tease people, he saw a worker working outside the school, he reported to the police that a student dressed as a worker was vandalizing the school, and then he went to tell the workers that if a police officer came, do not take him seriously. Both the workers and the police believed him,and it was only at the end of the story that they realized they had been tricked by the student. This story tells us that we need to have a mature mind, to take care of other people's feelings, and not to make jokes to cause trouble to others. That's what I got out of this listening material. Thank you all.
